            <h1>Ride It Out</h1>
<p>Spring has sprung and it’s the perfect time to enjoy all the benefits of riding your bike. <br/>
Register for Ride it Out and we’ll help you get ready for a summer of biking. </p>



<h1>Each week we’ll share a theme to motivate you to get back in the saddle: </h1>
<h2>🧡 Week 1 Ride - HEALTHY</h2>
<p>A chance to saddle up and enjoy all the health benefits of biking, from sleeping better to living longer and everything in between.</p>

<h1>🌈 Week 2 Ride - RELAXED</h1>
<p>A week dedicated to the wellbeing aspects of biking. Whether it’s riding with friends, reconnecting with nature or reducing stress levels, this week is all about enjoying the ride at your own pace.</p>

<h1>🌍 Week 3 Ride - GREEN</h1>
<p>Help save the planet by swapping cars for handlebars! Swap one of your regular journeys to a bike ride; it can be a grocery shop, school run, commute and we’ll share some tips to make it simple.</p>

<h1>☀️ Week 4 Ride - FREE </h1>
<p>Ride it Out will finish with a week of adventures from the saddle. We want everyone to do something new on their ride! The adventure can be big or small like heading to a new place, riding at night, going off-road, cycling with a friend...there are so many possibilities, that’s why they’re called freedom machines. </p>
